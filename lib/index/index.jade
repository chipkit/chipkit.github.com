        Welcome Interns!  Today we are embarking on an exciting journey to
        create the next great application.  In order to accomplish this,
        Comcast has partnered with Bug Labs to deliver specific hardware and
        software modules.

      p.
        This system, named the Comcast Hardware Innovation Platform (CHIP)
        platform, will enable YOU to create the Internet of Things (IoT) and
        other robust applications. With your help, we will be building
        applications over the next few months, which we'll then be able to
        deliver immediately to the field for trials.

      p.
        Later this year, we'll be working with startups and Universities to
        get their applications running on the platform, and eventually, we
        hope to see your applications running in homes across the country.

      p.
        Please read on to learn more about the system, and feel free to visit
        the following links to learn more about Comcast and Bug Labs.

          Familiarize yourself with some of the underlying software
          and hardware technologies that are responsible for running 
          the CHIP platform.
          This section provides links to articles, tutorials,
          and specifications that will garner a solid foundation
          in preparation for the internship program.

        h2 The Internet of Things
        p.
          IoT describes a network-based system, which allows interaction between
          inanimate objects, and through which data may be collected or through
          which objects may be in some way controlled.  Both modalities may be
          present simultaneously.  A simple example of the former might be a 2D
          Bar Code, which provides information about an object to which it might
          be attached.  An example of the latter might be a Blood Pressure
          sensor, which could potentially receive commands from a remote host
          and relay back telemetry information upon successful execution of an
          operation.  IoT allows for the "creation of smart environments/spaces
          and self-aware things (for example: smart transport, products, cities,
          buildings, rural areas, energy, health, living, etc.) for climate,
          food, energy, mobility, digital society and health applications."

          The CHIP modules include WiFi, BlueTooth, xBee, Motion Sensors, Gas
          Sensors, Arduino Shield Adapter, Media Module, Cable Modem, DECT,
          RF4CE, and many more.    With these modules, a developer can snap
          together the hardware and build software applications in Java, Python,
          C, and C++, using an Eclipse Software development environment.
